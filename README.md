# DAO Pattern Using JDBC

In the dao package there are three classes:
  1- The Student class: Contains student information that will be stored in the database.
  2- The StudentDAO class: Contains methods that will affect the database such as addStudent, deleteStudent, etc.
  3- The JdbcDao class: Contains the main method.
